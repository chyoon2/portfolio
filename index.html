            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p class="about"> I grew up in Mill Creek, WA a tight knit community north of Seattle. After college I started my professional career in the healthcare field. 
              During my time as an Office Assistant then Office Manager at Eyes of Seattle, Most importantly, I learned to provide excellent patient care and worked to overcome 
              the challenges in the healthcare system to get people the services they needed. As an outgoing kid, I was lucky to catch the theater bug early. Now as a teacher
              and producer at the Pocket Theater, I derive most of my enjoyment from helping  artists come together and leading them on paths to success. Theater is where I  learned
              to work both happily and efficiently in a fast-paced, busy environment. I’ve  listened to students and artists and developed systems to meet their needs and  requests; 
              I created and maintained an open, professional culture emphasizing  community. Community and creative expression are aspects of our health that often go overlooked.
