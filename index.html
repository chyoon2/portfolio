      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p class="about"> I started my professional career in the healthcare field. During my time as an  Office Assistant then Office Manager at Eyes of Seattle, 
        I developed healthy business relationships with  labs, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance  companies. I also stayed current with HIPAA and CMS 
        authorization codes and  guidelines to ensure proper billing reconciliation.  Most importantly, I learned to  provide excellent patient care and client 
        support and worked to overcome the  challenges in the healthcare system to get people the services they needed.  
        As an outgoing kid, I was lucky to catch the theater bug early. Now as a teacher  and producer at the Pocket Theater, I derive most of my enjoyment from 
        helping  artists come together and leading them on paths to success. Theater is where I  learned to work both happily and efficiently in a fast-paced, 
        busy environment. I’ve  listened to students and artists and developed systems to meet their needs and  requests; I created and maintained an open, 
        professional culture emphasizing  community. Community and creative expression are aspects of our health that  often go overlooked.
